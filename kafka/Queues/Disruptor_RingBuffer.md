# **Disruptor Library: A Low-Latency Messaging Library by LMAX**  
Disruptor is an **ultra-fast, lock-free** inter-thread messaging library designed to replace traditional queues. It provides **high-performance inter-thread communication** with minimal latency and garbage collection overhead.  

---

## **How RingBuffer Works in Disruptor**
- **Pre-allocated fixed-size array of entries** ‚Üí Avoids dynamic memory allocation.  
- **Uses sequence numbers** to track the positions of producers and consumers.  
- **Multiple consumers can read events without contention.**  
- **Avoids locks and garbage collection**, making it extremely fast.

## **Key Concepts in Disruptor**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ RingBuffer**  
A circular array used to store **events/messages** in a fixed-size structure. It enables efficient producer-consumer communication.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Sequence Number**  
Tracks event positions to ensure **ordered processing** while allowing parallel execution where applicable.  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Producer**  
- Writes events into the **RingBuffer**.  
- Before publishing, it **reserves a slot** using the **sequencer**.  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Consumer**  
- Reads events from the **RingBuffer** based on the **sequence number**.  
- Ensures that events are processed **in order** (if needed).  

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ WaitStrategy**  
Defines how consumers wait for new data:  
- **Busy-spin** ‚Üí Low latency, high CPU usage.  
- **Yield** ‚Üí Balances CPU usage and latency.  
- **Blocking** ‚Üí Lower CPU usage, but adds slight latency.

## **Event Reprocessing After Failure (Avoiding Event Loss)**
To ensure reliability and **recover from failures**, Disruptor can:  
- **Retry events after a backoff time**.  
- **Store the sequence in a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)** for later processing.  
- **Persist sequence numbers in a database/storage** to allow event replay when a consumer recovers.  

---

## **Avoiding Duplicate Event Processing in Parallel Consumers**
Disruptor ensures that **each event is processed exactly once** by:  
- **Distributing (load balancing) events among multiple consumers**, ensuring each event is picked by only one consumer.  
- **Ensuring no two consumers process the same event** when using a **worker pool** strategy.  
- **Assigning each event to a single worker (consumer group) for processing**.  
- **Using Sequence Barriers** to maintain order where necessary.
