Perfect — let’s walk through a clean and scalable **system design for Reddit-style nested comments using PostgreSQL**.

We’ll design:

1. Data model
2. Fetching full nested comments
3. Pagination
4. Vote support (optional)

---

## 🏗️ 1. Data Model (PostgreSQL)

```sql
CREATE TABLE comments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  post_id UUID NOT NULL,
  parent_id UUID,             -- NULL for top-level comments
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  votes INT DEFAULT 0,

  FOREIGN KEY (post_id) REFERENCES posts(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (parent_id) REFERENCES comments(id)
);
```

### ✅ Explanation

* `parent_id` allows for **arbitrary depth** in nesting.
* Every comment is linked to a `post_id`.
* This keeps the structure normalized and scalable.

---

## 🔍 2. Fetching Nested Comments (Recursive Query)

To fetch all nested comments under a post:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE comment_tree AS (
  SELECT *, 0 AS depth
  FROM comments
  WHERE post_id = 'POST_UUID' AND parent_id IS NULL

  UNION ALL

  SELECT c.*, ct.depth + 1
  FROM comments c
  JOIN comment_tree ct ON c.parent_id = ct.id
)
SELECT * FROM comment_tree
ORDER BY created_at ASC;
```

### 🔎 What this gives you:

* All top-level comments and their replies (recursively).
* You get a `depth` column for UI indentation.
* Maintains hierarchy with efficient DB traversal.

---

## 📚 3. Pagination Strategy

For deep nesting, it's common to:

* Paginate **top-level comments** (e.g., 10 at a time)
* Load **replies on-demand**

So for paginating top-level:

```sql
SELECT * FROM comments
WHERE post_id = 'POST_UUID' AND parent_id IS NULL
ORDER BY created_at ASC
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;
```

For replies to one comment (say comment `abc`):

```sql
SELECT * FROM comments
WHERE parent_id = 'abc'
ORDER BY created_at ASC;
```

---

## ⭐ Optional: Votes Table

To support upvotes/downvotes:

```sql
CREATE TABLE comment_votes (
  user_id UUID,
  comment_id UUID,
  vote INT CHECK (vote IN (-1, 1)), -- -1 = downvote, 1 = upvote
  PRIMARY KEY (user_id, comment_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (comment_id) REFERENCES comments(id)
);
```

Then, you can precompute and store `votes` on the `comments` table or calculate it with:

```sql
SELECT comment_id, SUM(vote) as total_votes
FROM comment_votes
GROUP BY comment_id;
```

## 🧠 Summary of Advantages

| Feature                | Why This Works Well             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Recursive structure    | ✅ Clean via `parent_id` + CTEs  |
| Efficient fetching     | ✅ 1 query can pull entire tree  |
| Pagination             | ✅ Easy on top-level and replies |
| Vote support           | ✅ Normalized and scalable       |
| Joins with users/posts | ✅ Native to relational DB       |

---

## ⚡ Tip for Interviews

When asked this again, you can say:

> “Since Reddit comments are deeply nested and need recursion, filtering, joins (for user info, vote counts, etc.), I’d choose PostgreSQL. It supports recursive CTEs which are perfect for hierarchical data, and lets me paginate and sort efficiently without complex workarounds.”

That statement shows **clear thinking**, **trade-off awareness**, and **domain-fit database selection** — exactly what they look for.

# With dynamoDb or no sql db( not recommended but worth knowing)

Great — let’s now look at how to **model Reddit-style nested comments in NoSQL**, particularly in:

1. **DynamoDB** (your original choice)
2. **MongoDB** (a document-based NoSQL database better suited for nested data)

---

## 🔹 1. **DynamoDB Design for Nested Comments**

### 🔧 Core Idea:

DynamoDB doesn’t support recursion or joins, so we must **denormalize** or design based on **access patterns**.

---

### ✅ Table Design (Single Table Model)

| PK (Partition Key) | SK (Sort Key)        | Type     | Data                         |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------- |
| `POST#123`         | `COMMENT#<ts>#<cid>` | Comment  | comment text, parentId, etc. |
| `POST#123`         | `METADATA`           | PostMeta | post info, title, commentCnt |

#### Example item:

```json
{
  "PK": "POST#123",
  "SK": "COMMENT#20240628T1830#CMT001",
  "commentId": "CMT001",
  "parentId": null,
  "text": "Top level comment",
  "userId": "U001"
}
```

Replies:

```json
{
  "PK": "POST#123",
  "SK": "COMMENT#20240628T1831#CMT002",
  "commentId": "CMT002",
  "parentId": "CMT001",
  "text": "Reply to comment",
  "userId": "U002"
}
```

---

### 🔍 How You Fetch Data

* Fetch **all comments for a post**:

```plaintext
Query where PK = "POST#123"
```

Then on the backend, **reconstruct the tree** using parentId mapping.

* No joins, so all **user info must be fetched separately** or cached.

* No recursive query → logic must be in your **application layer**.

---

### ⚠️ Drawbacks

* Cannot efficiently paginate or sort by nested depth.
* Reconstructing tree in memory adds complexity.
* No server-side filtering on nested conditions.
* Good only for **flat or shallow nesting**.

---

## 🔹 2. **MongoDB Design for Nested Comments**

MongoDB supports rich JSON documents, making it more natural for nested structures.

---

### ✅ Option A: **Embedded Tree (for small depth)**

```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "postId": "123",
  "commentId": "c1",
  "userId": "u1",
  "text": "Top comment",
  "replies": [
    {
      "commentId": "c1-1",
      "userId": "u2",
      "text": "Reply to c1",
      "replies": [
        {
          "commentId": "c1-1-1",
          "userId": "u3",
          "text": "Reply to c1-1"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### ✅ Option B: **Adjacency List (more scalable)**

```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "postId": "123",
  "commentId": "c2",
  "parentId": "c1",
  "text": "Reply to c1",
  "userId": "u2"
}
```

Use `$graphLookup` for recursive traversal (MongoDB equivalent of SQL CTE):

```js
db.comments.aggregate([
  { $match: { postId: "123", parentId: null } },
  {
    $graphLookup: {
      from: "comments",
      startWith: "$commentId",
      connectFromField: "commentId",
      connectToField: "parentId",
      as: "nestedReplies"
    }
  }
])
```

## 🔚 Summary: SQL vs DynamoDB vs MongoDB

| Feature                     | PostgreSQL               | DynamoDB                 | MongoDB              |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| Recursion (nested comments) | ✅ Recursive CTE          | ❌ App-side only          | ✅ `$graphLookup`     |
| Joins with users, votes     | ✅ Yes                    | ❌ No                     | ⚠️ Limited           |
| Scalability                 | ⚠️ Vertical              | ✅ High                   | ✅ Moderate-High      |
| Schema flexibility          | ❌ Fixed                  | ✅ Very Flexible          | ✅ Flexible           |
| Tree reconstruction ease    | ✅ Easy in SQL            | ❌ Complex                | ✅ Easy in doc mode   |
| Preferred use case          | Structured, related data | High-scale, denormalized | JSON tree structures |

---

## 🧠 Recommendation

> Use **PostgreSQL** when you need: recursion, joins, strict consistency, structured queries.

> Use **MongoDB** when you want: flexible schemas and rich nested documents (but moderate scale).

> Use **DynamoDB** only when: you **don’t need recursion**, need **millisecond latency**, and can **live with app-side tree building**.
