To calculate the total number of writes per month on a platform with a **1000:1 read-to-write ratio** and **10 million active users**, you can follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( W \) represent the total number of writes per month.
   - Let \( R \) represent the total number of reads per month.
   - Given the read-to-write ratio of 1000:1, \( R = 1000 \times W \).

2. **Determine Total Operations**:
   - The total number of operations (reads and writes) per month \( T \) can be represented as:
   \[
   T = R + W = 1000W + W = 1001W
   \]

3. **Using User Interaction**:
   - If the average number of operations per user per month is known (e.g., average user reads and writes per month), you can calculate \( T \) by multiplying it by the total active users.
   - Assume each of the 10M users generates an average of \( O \) total operations (reads + writes) per month.

   Then:
   \[
   T = 10,000,000 \times O
   \]

4. **Calculate Total Writes**:
   - Rearrange the equation \( T = 1001W \) to solve for \( W \):
   \[
   W = \frac{T}{1001}
   \]

### Example:
Assume that, on average, each user performs 2000 total operations (reads + writes) per month:

- Total operations \( T \) would be:
\[
T = 10,000,000 \times 2000 = 20,000,000,000 \text{ operations}
\]

- Total writes \( W \) would be:
\[
W = \frac{20,000,000,000}{1001} \approx 19,980,019 \text{ writes}
\]

So, there would be approximately **19.98 million writes** per month in this scenario.
